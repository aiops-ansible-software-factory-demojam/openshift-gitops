# Collection development

Use fully qualified Ansible module names and keep roles idempotent. Put
configuration defaults in `roles/<role>/defaults/main.yml` and prefix their
names with the role name. Keep secret lookups outside roles.

Run `ansible-lint`, build the collection, and run the Molecule scenario before
opening a pull request. Update `extensions/molecule/default/verify.yml` to
check the feature's behavior. Never commit credentials.

Run `molecule test` from the collection root in a demo Omnigent sandbox. The
sandbox supplies `MOLECULE_GLOB`, the Kubernetes client, and a scoped test
kubeconfig. Keep the exact provisioner version in
`extensions/molecule/requirements-test.yml` and shared scenario configuration
in `extensions/molecule/config.yml`. Use the provisioner collection's lifecycle
playbooks and the existing CentOS Stream 10 DataSource with PodIP connections.

Keep VM names unique using the scenario's persistent run ID. After a failed
test, run `molecule destroy` in the same sandbox and checkout before deleting
its cache. Never remove the run ID while its VM might still exist. Serialize
concurrent runs of one scenario in a single checkout.
